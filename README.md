# Guess-the-Number

This is a classic guessing game that challenges your basic mathematical logic comprehension. Simply guess the number within a few tries to win. Compare the your previous guesses to the unknown number to narrow down your list of candidate numbers.

Algorithm: Below are the Steps:

User inputs the lower bound and upper bound of the range.

The compiler generates a random integer between the range and store it in a variable for future references.

For repetitive guessing, a while loop will be initialized.

If the user guessed a number which is greater than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try Again! You guessed too high“

Else If the user guessed a number which is smaller than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try Again! You guessed too small”

And if the user guessed in a minimum number of guesses, the user gets a “Congratulations! ” Output.

Else if the user didn’t guess the integer in the minimum number of guesses, he/she will get “Better Luck Next Time!” output.
